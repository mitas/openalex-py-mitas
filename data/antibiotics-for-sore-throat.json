    "data_collection": "Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted trial authors from three studies for additional information.",
    "results": "We included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. We did not identify any new trials in this 2013 update.1. SymptomsThroat soreness and fever were reduced by about half by using antibiotics. The greatest difference was seen at day three. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 21.2. Non-suppurative complicationsThe trend was antibiotics protecting against acute glomerulonephritis but there were too few cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds within one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.60).3. Suppurative complicationsAntibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); acute sinusitis within 14 days (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and quinsy within two months (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) compared to those taking placebo.4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reductionAntibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day three (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if throat swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97 if negative. Similarly at week one the RR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative Streptococcusswabs.",
    "conclusions": "Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in high-income countries requires treating many with antibiotics for one to benefit. This NNTB may be lower in low-income countries. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 16 hours overall."

      "Question": "This review sought to determine whether antibiotics are effective for treating the symptoms and reducing the potential complications associated with sore throats.",
      "Background": "Sore throats are infections caused by bacteria or viruses. People usually recover quickly (usually after three or four days), although some develop complications. A serious but rare complication is rheumatic fever, which affects the heart and joints. Antibiotics reduce bacterial infections but they can cause diarrhea, rash and other adverse effects and communities build resistance to them.",
      "Study characteristics": "The review is current to July 2013 and included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. All of the included studies were randomised, placebo-controlled trials which sought to determine if antibiotics helped reduce symptoms of either sore throat, fever and headache or the occurrence of more serious complications. Studies were conducted among both children and adults.",
      "Key results": "The review found that antibiotics shorten the duration of pain symptoms by an average of about one day and can reduce the chance of rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds in communities where this complication is common. Other complications associated with sore throat are also reduced through antibiotic use.",
      "Quality of evidence": "The quality of the included studies was moderate to high. However, there were very few recent trials included in the review (only three since 2000), hence it is unclear if changes in bacterial resistance in the community may have affected the effectiveness of antibiotics."

  "background": {
    "condition": "Sore throat is a very common reason for people to attend primary care settings (ABS 1985). Moreover, four to six times as many people suffering sore throat do not seek care (Goslings 1963; Horder 1954). Sore throat is a disease that remits spontaneously, that is, 'cure' is not dependent on treatment (Del Mar 1992c). Nonetheless, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for sore throat and other upper respiratory tract infections. There are large differences in clinical practice between countries (Froom 1990) and between primary care doctors (Howie 1971).",
    "intervention": "The administration of antibiotics is likely to shorten the time to the remittance of symptoms and reduce the likelihood of complications in patients whose sore throat has a bacteriological aetiology (van Driel 2013). However, their benefits may be limited in the treatment of sore throat more generally (Reveiz 2013). Traditionally, doctors have attempted to decide whether the cause of the infection is bacterial, especially when caused by the group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) (which can cause acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis). However, deciding the aetiological agent is difficult (Del Mar 1992b).",
    "theory": "Antibiotics target bacteria which are potentially responsible for sore throat symptoms and possible subsequent suppurative and non-suppurative sequelae. Successful eradication of bacteria may promote faster healing and prevention of secondary complications. However, not all sore throat cases are of bacteriologic origin and bacteria may resist antibiotic treatment which could limit the overall effectiveness of the intervention.",
    "importance": "Whether or not to prescribe antibiotics for sore throat is controversial. The issue is important because it is a very common disease and differences in prescribing result in large cost differences. Moreover, increased prescribing increases patient attendance rates (Howie 1978; Little 1997). This review is built on an early meta-analysis (Del Mar 1992a) and is an update of previous Cochrane Reviews (Del Mar 1997; Del Mar 2000; Del Mar 2004; Del Mar 2006; Spinks 2009)."

    "intervention_effects_summary": "Primary outcomes1. Symptoms of sore throat on day threeAt day three of the illness, antibiotics reduced symptoms of sore throat (risk ratio (RR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.79) (Analysis 1.1). Day three was the greatest time of benefit because the symptoms of only half the participants had settled.2. Symptoms of sore throat at one week (days six to eight)At one week (six to eight days) the RR of experiencing sore throat was 0.49 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.76) (Analysis 1.5), although 82% of controls were better by this time.Secondary outcomes1. Symptoms of fever at day threeAt day three of the illness, antibiotics reduced symptoms of fever (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10) (Analysis 2.1).2. Symptoms of headache at day threeAt day three of the illness, antibiotics reduced symptoms of headache (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71) (Analysis 3.1).3. Incidence of suppurative complicationsAntibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media to about one-third of that in the placebo group (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) (Analysis 4.4) and reduced the incidence of acute sinusitis to about one-half of that in the placebo group (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76) (Analysis 4.6). Data indicate that the incidence of quinsy was also reduced in relation to the placebo group (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) (Analysis 4.7).4. Incidence of non-suppurative complicationsCases of acute glomerulonephritis only occurred in the control group which suggests protection by antibiotics. However, there were only two cases and only 10 studies reported on acute glomerulonephritis as an endpoint. Therefore, our estimate of the protection has a very wide 95% CI (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.02 to 2.08) (Analysis 4.8) which precludes us from definitively claiming that antibiotics protect sore throat sufferers from acute glomerulonephritis.Several studies found benefit from antibiotics for acute rheumatic fever which reduced this complication to about one-quarter of that in the placebo group (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.60) (Analysis 4.1). Few studies examined antibiotics other than penicillin. Confining the analysis to penicillin alone resulted in no difference in estimated protection (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50) (Analysis 4.2).Subgroup analysis of symptom reduction1. Blind versus unblinded studiesThere was no significant difference between blinded and unblinded studies for symptoms of sore throat at day three (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.78 and RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.05, respectively) (Analysis 1.2) nor at one week (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.03 and RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.15, respectively) (Analysis 1.6). Contrary to expectation, the trend was for a greater effect of antibiotics for blind studies at day three.2. Antipyretics administered versus not administeredUse of antipyretics led to no significant difference between studies in which antipyretics were offered and those in which they were not (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.81 and RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70, respectively) (Analysis 1.3).3. Throat swabs positive for Streptococcus versus negative for Streptococcus versus not tested and/or inseparable combined dataThe probability of still experiencing pain on day three is slightly more than one-half (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) for those participants who had positive throat swabs for GABHS, compared to three-quarters (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) for those with negative swabs (Analysis 1.4). There was a similar effect at one week (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.70 and RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.07, respectively) (Analysis 1.7). That is, the effectiveness of antibiotics is increased in people with Streptococci growing in the throat.4. Children versus adultsThere were few studies that included children (younger than 13 years of age): only 61 cases in total for when fever was evaluated at day three. There was overlap of the RR 95% CI, so that the trend for children to not experience benefits was not significantly different to adults who did (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.13 and RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.51, respectively) (Analysis 2.3).Some of these results are summarised in Figure 3.A trial from Thailand was included in the 2003 update (Leelarasamee 2000). It is especially important because it is one of the few trials from a non-Western industrial country. Unfortunately we were unable to enter its data into the meta-analysis because of different ways of collecting the data (in particular no data were collected mid-way through the illness). Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics conferred no benefit (nor harms) on symptoms or complications."

  "discussion": {
    "summary_of_results": "1. SymptomsThroat soreness and fever were reduced by about half when using antibiotics. The greatest difference was seen at day three. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 21. Antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day three and one week if throat swabs were positive for Streptococcus compared to negative throat swabs.2. Non-suppurative complicationsAntibiotics showed a trend for protecting against acute glomerulonephritis but there were too few cases for the results to reach statistical significance. Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds.3. Suppurative complicationsAntibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of acute otitis media by two-thirds, acute sinusitis by a half and quinsy by 85% compared to those taking placebo.Authors' conclusionsAntibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in high-income countries requires treating many with antibiotics for one to benefit. This NNTB may be lower in low-income countries. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 16 hours overall.",
    "applicability_of_findings": "The majority of trials included in this review were conducted prior to 1975, with only three trials published since 2000. The main reason for this is that very few antibiotic trials conducted recently include a placebo control arm. It is therefore unknown whether changes in bacterial resistance and population immunity over time may have altered the applicability of results.",
    "quality_of_evidence": "The quality of the evidence is considered to be moderate to high. The greatest compromise to evidence quality arose from non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures.",
    "potential_biases": "Non-reporting of anti-pyretic use in a high number of studies may have constituted a source of bias in the results. Publication bias may also be considered a potential threat to the validity of results, particularly for the earlier studies.",
    "agreement_disagreement": "A recent review analysing the risk-benefit profile of antimicrobial prescribing for children concluded that antibiotics show little benefit in preventing quinsy following sore throat (Keith 2010). A clinical evidence review of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis concluded that among patients with signs and symptoms of positive bacterial infection, a specific diagnosis should be determined by performing either a throat culture or rapid antigen-detection test, especially in children (Wessels 2011). Antibiotic treatment with penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is then recommended in the case of positive bacteriologic assessment."
  },
  "conclusions": {
    "implications_for_practice": "Antibiotics have a beneficial effect on both suppurative and symptom reduction.The effect on symptoms is small, so that clinicians must judge with individual cases whether it is clinically justifiable to employ antibiotics to produce this effect. In other words their use should be discretionary rather than either prohibited or mandatory. Since 90% of patients are symptom-free by one week (whether or not treated with antibiotics), the absolute benefit of antibiotics at this time and beyond is vanishingly small.Acute rheumatic fever is common among people living in some parts of the world (Australian Aborigines living in low socio-economic conditions, for example) and antibiotics may be justified to reduce the incidence of this complication in these settings. For other settings where rheumatic fever is rare, there is a balance to be made between modest symptom reduction and the hazards of antimicrobial resistance.",
    "implications_for_research": "More trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries and also in children. In high-income countries, better prognostic studies are called for which can predict which patients may develop suppurative and non-suppurative complications. This will help to further define which patients benefit from antibiotics.Studies which use patient-centred outcome measures compatible with those presented here would be greatly beneficial, in terms of easier comparison and analysis of results and ready inclusion into future updates of this review.Few trials have attempted to measure the severity of symptoms. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis."
